    "about": "Welcome to my website! My name is Tyler and I am an aspiring software developer from Quinnipiac University. Here I study software engineering on a path to graduate in 2026. After that, I plan on furthering my education by attaining my master's degree in cybersecurity in 2027. While I am always eager and open to learning new subsets of this field, my primary interest lies in web development. I have also done some deep dives into the emerging field of artificial intelligence which should be evidenced by my projects section. Thank you for taking the time to check out my website and enjoy!",
